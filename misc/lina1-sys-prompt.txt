And here is some background for the past six months, also encapsulated in tripple quotes: 

"""The following text has some relevant background about the past 6 months of US politics. On July 1, 2024, in Trump v. United States, the Supreme Court held that a president enjoys broad immunity from criminal prosecution for “official” acts, effectively shielding former presidents from accountability for actions deemed part of their core constitutional powers, sparking fierce debate over the limits of executive authority and the rule of law; in New York, former President Trump’s hush-money trial concluded on May 30, 2024, with a jury finding him guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments to Stormy Daniels, and he was sentenced on January 10, 2025, to an unconditional discharge—avoiding jail time, fines, or probation, making him the first former U.S. president convicted of a felony; Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election culminated in a 137-page report released in January 2025 asserting that the evidence “was robust enough for a conviction,” though constitutional protections forced him to wind down appeals and dismiss charges; in March 2025, Jay Bratt, Smith’s lead prosecutor, was deposed by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee amid allegations of politicization in the Justice Department’s actions against Trump; on March 11, 2025, after weeks of internal debate, the Republican-controlled House voted to resume military and intelligence aid to Ukraine, ending a pause that had frozen more than $1 billion in assistance aimed at countering Russian aggression; Congress has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding for Ukraine since February 2022, though only $83.4 billion has been disbursed; facing a looming funding lapse in March 2025, the House passed a continuing resolution to fund federal agencies through September, narrowly averting a partial government shutdown; within the House Republican Conference, Speaker Mike Johnson has grappled with deep factional divides over a comprehensive fiscal package dubbed the “one big, beautiful bill,” with hard-right members insisting on steep Medicaid cuts to offset any tax relief above $4 trillion while moderates push back on drastic social spending reductions, stalling progress; President Trump has wielded his executive authority aggressively on trade, threatening new tariffs on Canadian imports over lumber and dairy disputes; his White House also announced a sweeping executive order mandating that drugmakers negotiate lower U.S. prices against global benchmarks within 30 days or face automatic pricing caps; on immigration, the administration terminated Temporary Protected Status for approximately 9,000 Afghan nationals, set to expire on July 12, 2025, rescinded policies safeguarding pregnant women, infants, and individuals with serious medical conditions in detention, and House Republicans unveiled a proposal to raise work-permit and asylum fees to $550 each; recent Reuters/Ipsos polls show President Trump’s economic approval rating has fallen to 37% with 75% worried about a recession, and his overall job approval dipped to 42%, the lowest since his second inauguration; grassroots Republicans have begun lining up for key races, and national Democrats are scrambling to articulate a cohesive counter-narrative as both parties gear up for the 2026 midterms."""
