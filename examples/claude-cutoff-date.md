## In May 2025, I asked Claude (using a free plan): 

"Can you tell me about the latest political news in the US?"

## Here's Claude's full response: 

"I can share what I know about recent US political developments, though my knowledge has a cutoff at the end of October 2024, so things may have changed since then.

The most significant recent development was the 2024 presidential election in November, where Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2025. This represents Trump's return to the presidency after his previous term from 2017-2021.

Beyond this major election outcome, I wouldn't be able to provide details about more recent political developments, policy changes, or current events that have occurred since my knowledge cutoff. For the most up-to-date political news and analysis, I'd recommend checking current news sources like major newspapers, news websites, or political news outlets that can provide you with the latest information about what's happening in Washington and across the country.

Is there anything specific about US politics you're particularly interested in discussing?"
