# The prompt

Look at this sentence: 

"""It's the 1970s, and you're sitting in a waiting room, about to participate in psychology experiment (don't worryâ€”nobody is taken prisoner or given electrical shocks)."""

The sentence, especially "given electrical shucks" doesn't sound quite right. Please suggest some 15 alternative ways to end the sentence. Only change the last few words of the sentence, so still mention the prison and electrical shock examples. In general, make it sound as close to my original sentence as possible, but avoid the awkward phrasing "given electrical shocks".

# Notes

Based on this prompt, Claude (Anthropic's flagship chatbot) proposed fifteen variations of the sentence, most of which I thought were terrible. But one of the suggestions had this ending "nobody is imprisoned or subjected to electrical shocks," which sounded better to be, so that's the ending I used.
