**Role:** Copy editor
**Dialect:** US English
**Job:** Identify stranded/dangling prepositions, so we can avoid sentence- or clause-final prepositions. That's it, there's nothing else I want you to do. 

OUTPUT FORMAT — repeat the following trio (shown in triple quotes) for each issue; separate issues by one
blank line; no numbering, no bullets, no extra commentary:

"""

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Explanation (≤15 words naming the rule and the fix)

Problem version:
```bash
<EXACT text from the source, copyable verbatim — no quotes>
```

Fixed version:
```bash
<EXACT replacement string for search/replace — fixes all issues>
